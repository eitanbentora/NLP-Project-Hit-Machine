I've been thinking of you for a long time, and I don't know what to do with it.
          Am                          G           F
It's all the same, but I think it'll be alright,
            Am          G       F
'Cause you're the one to lose it
             F                            C
And I can only hope that you get it right
            F                                        G
So let me tell you one thing: I love you more than I ever knew
            F                            C
If I had my chance, I would have it all
      F                              G
But I know that I wont win
   Am                   G            F
As long as I was old enough to know
               Am         G     F
That I could never win, oh
             F                           C
When I saw you in my darkest night
         F                      G
We'd be playing the game
                  F                                      C
Of chance to win. And if you had your chances, then I wouldnt give up
                   F                     G
To be the king of the universe
         Am                             G              F
In the end, when you were young enough for me
        Am               G             F
All the things that we had in our lives
          Am                 G                            F
Are all right, the ones that made us strong enough
       Am                 G                      F
For the rest of my life, it is all good enough. But i'm not gonna let you down
 Am                   G                          F

The game of chance is a game, and it's the game that I'm playing
G7                        Am7                     D
I don't know if I will win, but I just want to play it
                   C                               G7
And I got it all right, 'cause I am playing it right
    Am7                       D                    C
But i've been playing this game for so long, I guess I should have known
                     G7                     Am7                     
That I was playing my game and I had to give it up
C                       G7               Am7
To be the one to make it through the night
    G7                    Am7                         
Now I have to lose, to be able to win
     D                  G7                     C
If I play my part, then I might have lost
    Am7               D
So I can play that game
       G7           Am7                 
My destiny is my destiny, my fate is yours
        C             G7  C
For the life of my life

There is no end to the way you play
            C                                     G7             C
When you are playing your game I must have seen
        C7            G7               
It was the best thing I could ever do
                Am7                 D
By playing the games that you played
 G7              Am7                    
A lot of fun, so I think you might be
        D7                 G7
In the end I would have won
                Am7                                    D
Take my hand, take my mind, give me the chance
      G7                      Am7               
Get my hands, pick me up, put me down
                          D7                     G7
Give me all my heart, get me out of the race
                Am7                                D
Put me back in the future, let me take you home
        G7                           Am7          
Let me give you everything I want

The game of chance is a game
Bm          G            Bm
And it's not the game that you play
            G          D
But you've got to play it to win.
Bm           G          Bm
I'm gonna win it 'til the end of time
                G      D
When the games are over, I can bet
                    Bm
That they'll never get it right
             G             D
So I guess I should just keep playing it
Bm           G                     Bm
If I could do it all again, then I would just play my part
                     G                      D                      Bm
Oh, and I will play all the time, but I wont play the whole time again
                G         D
You'd better watch me if you could
                     Bm
In the world oh, it will be the same

Yeah, yea, you gotta have fun, yeah

My friend, my friend

Trying to get me out of my mind
 G                            D
One day I might lose it, one day i will win
             Bm                            G
Just another chance to make it through the night

To make the most of what we have
Bm                                     G             D
No matter what happens to me, no matter how hard I try
Bm                                    G            D
Keep on playing my game, keep on doing my best
 G                            D
Every time I play, everytime I do,
      Bm                           G
All I wanna do is give my all, all I want, is to be king
D                        Bm
Someday I may lose my life, someday
       G                      D
Maybe I just want to know what you got

Eb7    F                  G
I'm in love with a man who's so beautiful
Eb7    F                   G
And I can't help but think of him
      F             Eb7
When I see him in my eyes
    F                              G
He'll tell me he'd never leave me
    F                  Eb7
But if I were to leave you
   F                      G
Then I would never give up
      F                Eb7
If I was to take you away
        F             G
From the pain of my life
         F          G
You've got to understand
       F               Eb7
That I am not the one
           F                             G
Who can do the things that I do

To make me feel the way I want you to
           F                             G
Forgive me for what I have done
      F                             Eb7
All I need is your love, and I will be yours
               G
As long as you're gone
      F                         Eb7
Oh, I know that i can see your face
           G                     Cm7
Because I love you more than I could ever see
       F
In your eyes, in your head
       Eb7
My heart is swollen, but I feel like it
             G               Cm7
So give me my heart, my soul
                    F        F/A     
Let me tell you all that you want me to be
Cm7
Can you believe me?
Cm7                        F
How can you see me go
                         G
Do you know how to make it last
                          Bb
Will you let me know what you need
         Cm7                        F              
Cause I think I might be able to change my mind
          G
With you, with you...
           F
Lord, it is so hard to see, you can only see (yeah)

Don't you have to lose your mind
